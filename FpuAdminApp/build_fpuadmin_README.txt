19/1/2021 Bart W: The build_fpuadmin.sh script is an initial quick build script
just to get a command-line build of the fpu-admin app working (in addition to
the existing Eclipse IDE project build). However, the top-level FPU Makefile
will eventually need to be modified to do this build, and this script can 
then be retired.
