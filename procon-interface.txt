Pro converting all into interface:

- can use class independent of ESO framework in Python
- can use locks etc internally
- protection layer in interface
- isolates namespace stuff from implementation
- access single-threaded, but thread-safe where needed

- reserve driver for domain logic
- easier simulation (just use variant of interface)


Cons:
- don't understand "driver" completely
- semantics unclear (multi-threading etc)
- unclear how to test - but easier when implemenattion is independent
