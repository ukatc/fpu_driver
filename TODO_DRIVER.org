* TODO DEsign questions

** TODO subobjects for CAN gateways
** TODO command protocol

** TODO naming of classes
- class for CAN Bus level object GatewayDriver
- class for whole grid of FPUs GridDriver (to avoid clash with Python library)

* TODO code CAN driver

** DONE file preamble
** DONE write class skeleton
- [X] add members
  - [X] state array
  - [X] struct: ready, pending and error counters
  - [X] socket
  - [X] read and write buffers
  - [X] condition variable
  - [X] state mutex
  - [X] sending and receiving threads


- [X] initialisation / constructor / destructor code
