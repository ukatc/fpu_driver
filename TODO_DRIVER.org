time_spec_add_safe), also  use TIME_T_MAX from time.h)
** DONE Base CommandQueue length on NUMFPUS * 256, 
  for the wavetable loading
** DONE Define two enums for the CAN driver:
 one for the driver state, and one for 
 the last error
** DONE command interface (draft)

- [ ] does that need a class and interface?

** DONE Improvements
*** DONE API methods hould return state reference parameter
.. in output argument. This requires an additional lock
when the internal state struct is used.
*** DONE fix name field in header
*** DONE put commands in namespace
*** DONE put can level stuff into namespace
*** DONE split methods in initialize() / uninitialize():
   anywhere we allocate memory via the STL, to catch
   out-of-memory exceptions

   Also, thread tghrough the calls of these methods
   up to the top level.

*** DONE Bugfix broadast command for more than one bus
*** DONE Lift waveform restriction for zero movement (DEFINE)
*** DONE Update tutorial on allowed waveforms
*** DONE Fix multiplexing of broadcast commands (currently, they are only sent to bus 0)
    One CAN command for each bus needs to be generated,
    not only for each gateway.
    This affects both the serialization code in send_buffer,
    the generation of broadcast commands in the gateway method,
    and the update of pending commands which needs to filter
    by busid.
