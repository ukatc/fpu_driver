NOTE: This folder contains historical documentation written by Johannes Nix.
The documents have not been updated since 2019 and reflect the state of the
software at that time.

The documents are written in LaTex and are difficult to update. Any important
information required by ESO needs to be brough up to date and written in a
more portable format.
