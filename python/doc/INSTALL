INSTALLATION OF FPU DRIVER


PREREQUISITES
=============

1) A 64-bit Linux system with kernel 2.6 or newer.  (Debian >= 9,
   Ubuntu >= 17.10, Scientific Linux >= 2017, Arch Linux are all
   supported).

2) for the C++ driver and static library

 * gcc-4.9 (essentially, with support for C++11)
 * Linux-2.6 or newer (requiring support for eventfd)
 * glibc-2.3.2 (epoll support)
 * liblmdb0 (Lightning Memory database, aka LMDB)
 * lmdb-utils (contains backup utility for LMDB)

3) for the test code and Python bindings

 * Python-2.7
 * boost-1-66 , which can be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/users/download/
 * python-lmdb (Python bindings)


4) For running the hardware simulation

 * Python-2.7 or Python-3.5
 * the gevent module (pip install gevent)

5) for generating the documentation from scratch (normally not needed)

* LaTeX, for example tex-live

* the minted package

* python-pygments or pygments (normally contained in tex-live)

* inkscape (to generate pictures from SVG vector drawings)



INSTALLATION
============

INSTALLING BOOST LIBRARIES
--------------------------

Recent Boost libraries are required to build the Python module, which
is needed in the verification system (but not in the final ICS
software).

Please keep in mind that any installed different version of boost
libraries is very likely an essential part of your Linux system, so do
NOT uninstall older versions from your system!

* for security, verify boost package signature using gnupg

* unpack boost package:

$ tar xzf boost_1_66_0.tar.gz

* build package:

$ cd boost_1_66_0/
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./b2

* install package into /usr/local directory:

$ su
# ./b2 install

To make the boost libraries accessible when the
final program is run, you need to add the
two commands

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

to your shell configuration (usually, $HOME/.bashrc).

Also, you should add the directory with the boost header files (by
default /usr/local/include) to the path configured in the environment
variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, so that gcc can find them when building
the module.

INSTALLING GEVENT MODULE
------------------------

The Python mock-up gateway uses the gevent
library which is used to serve parallel requests
using asynchronous code. In difference to
Python3's asyncio, it is available both in
Pyhon2 and Python3.

Install it as follows:

pip install gevent

(This command seems to be need to be run as root in order to install
under /usr/local ).



BUILDING THE DRIVER
-------------------

Build the driver as follows:

# cd fpu_driver
# git checkout master
# make driver

This places the static library libfpudriver.a into
the subdirectory "/lib".

BUILDING THE PYTHON MODULE
--------------------------

Run

# make wrapper

This builds the binary extension module fpu_driver.so
and places it into the subdirectory /python.
In the same subdirectory, there are some test
scripts which can be used to test the module.


GENERATING THE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------

The documentation can be generated with the command

# make manual

The generated PDF has the path name
python/doc/manual.pdf .



RUNNING THE TEST GATEWAY
------------------------

In the sub-directory /testing, the package contains a mock-up test
gateway which responds to messages as specified by the hardware
protocol. To run it, change into a new terminal window and
issue

# cd test/HardwareSimulation

python2 mock_gateway.py


This test code opens three socket connections on localhost and will
display received messages and commands. Depending on available CPU
power, will not necessarily run with exactly the same speed as the
real hardware but should match the hardware protocol faithfully. The
parameter "-N" allows to set the number of simulated FPUs.

Use the command line option "--help" or "-h" to check for additional
features, such as simulating communication failures etc.

In another terminal window, you can run the tests:
cd python
python2 -i test_mock/test_findDatum.py
and so on.
