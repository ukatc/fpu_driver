Ticket Information:
Title:

Priority/Urgency:
Very important, and has time until the first week of November.

Description:
I will be leaving the MOONS project on November 22.

Currently, most of the code is on the nippes laptop, including user and API documentation and protocol definitions. Documentation is already included in the LiveLink system. Code is stored in several git repositories on nippes in the subfolder

/home/jnix/MOONS

Exact copies (clones) of these git repositories are on the dalriada server,
in the directory ~jnix/MOONS aka /sw/sw4/jnix/MOONS, and on the MOONS lab pc moons-pc01.roe.ac.uk in /home/jnix and /moonsdata. Further copies of some of the code are in the ESO subversion repository, but these do not contain the complete version history. and do not include the internal projects which are not deliverables to ESO.


Where should the code be finally moved to?

There is a Moons folder on the Projects server. This is backed up.
\\roe.ac.uk\shares\projects.
for those with a windows PC it should be mapped as H:

Does this have an NFS mount, too? This might be a bit easier to use in this case because development was done in Linux.

dalriada:/sw/sw4 is in the daily bacula backups. These are retained for a year; but until the original gets removed on dalriada, the full backups will always include what sw4 contains at that time.
As for final storage, that is kinda up to SEG to figure out a scheme, or perhaps sw4 is already being kept an eye on to make sure its content survives somewhere forever. Perhaps sw4 is just that.
