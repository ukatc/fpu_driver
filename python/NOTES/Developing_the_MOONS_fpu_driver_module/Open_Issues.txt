====== Open Issues ======
Created Friday 01 November 2019

The JIRA link [[https://ukatcfaultlog.atlassian.net/browse/MOONS-373?jql=project%20%3D%20MOONS%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20component%20%3D%20FPU_Driver%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC|Issues for the MOONS FPU driver software]] contains
a list of remaining open issues for the driver development.

Here is how some of these issues relate to other tasks in the
MOONS development:

* MOONS-181 convert FPU driver into an ESO special device for the ICS
  This is necessary to fit the driver into the final control system.
   Most of the testing and debugging has already been done at this point,
  as it is much easier and quicker to test using the Python wrapper.

* MOONS-178 Convert software protection layer to C++
  this is required by MOONS-181

* MOONS-310  Dynamical measurement of FPU movements
 This is an integration test for path planning, FPU hardware, and driver

* MOONS-95 Adapt configuration of FPU driver to allow flexible mapping of FPU addresses
This is needed to test the driver in a large grid which uses several gateways
