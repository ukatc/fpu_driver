====== Python3 compatibility ======
Created Thursday 31 October 2019

The Python wrapper and the [[+EtherCAN_simulation]] are
implemented in Python2. They were not yet ported 
in order to save time. However, no extraordinary difficulties
are expected if the code is ported to Python3. Especially,
gevent (on which the [[+EtherCAN_simulation]] is based)
supports both Python2 and Python3, and boost::python
supports both Python versions.
