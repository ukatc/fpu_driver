====== HowToUse git-svn ======
Created Friday 01 November 2019

   The following  command was used to initialize the mpifs git-svn repository:

''git svn clone -r 244403:HEAD  http://jnix@svnhq1.hq.eso.org/p1/ \''
	   ''--trunk=trunk/Instruments/Paranal/MOONS/ --branches=branches/MOONS/ \''
	   ''--tags=tags/Release/MOONS/'' 


This command runs for a long time, because it has to check out every SVN
version since the MOONS project was started, to store it locally.
After this, local development can use the standard git commands.
The command "git svn rebase" refreshes the master branch with
the state of the SVN repository. The command "git svn dcommit"
sends the local changes to the SVN repository.

Note that, because rebase is used, the local changes in the
git repository must be kept private, and cannot be synced
to other local repositories, using git pull. However, it is
possible to copy the local repositiry in order to use
it on a different computer - this is much faster than the
initial checkout.
