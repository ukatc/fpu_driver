====== Information on this document ======

This document describes procedures and information which
is useful to develop the MOONS fpu driver. It is addressed
to developers which need to change, debug, or integrate the driver.

It does not cover the concurrency architecture, which is decribed
in a seperate document.

Generally, this document strives hard to reduce redundancy,
by linking to original descriptions and instructions where
available.

This document is maintained using the [[https://zim-wiki.org/|Zim Desktop wiki software]],
which is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows, and can easily be 
edited using this software. 

An exported PDF copy of it is stored in the LiveLink system. The
source text for the exported document is maintained along
with the source code in the FPU driver git repository, and
underlies the same version control.
