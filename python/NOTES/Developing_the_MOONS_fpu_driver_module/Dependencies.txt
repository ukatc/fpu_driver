====== Dependencies ======

The fpu_driver code can be grouped into two parts:


1. The core driver, which is a C++ library
2. The python wrapper and test environment.

The first part has only minimum dependencies. Required are a standard Linux kernel, and gcc 
as compiler. Future versions will depend on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database|LMDB memory database]] (because LMDB will become part of the core driver).

The Python wrapper and test environment depends mainly on:
* Python 2
* boost::python, to generate interface
* LMDB and its corresponding Python wrapper module

How to install and configure the dependencies is described in detail in [[../../INSTALL_LONG]].
