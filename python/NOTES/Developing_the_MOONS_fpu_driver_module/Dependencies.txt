====== Dependencies ======

The fpu_driver code can be grouped into two parts:

1. The core driver, which is a pure C++11 library, written for Linux and gcc.
2. The python wrapper and test environment.

The first part has only minimum dependencies. Required are a standard Linux kernel, and gcc 
as compiler. Future versions will depend on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database|LMDB memory database]] (because LMDB will become part of the core driver).

The Python wrapper and test environment depends mainly on:
* Python 2
* [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html|boost::python]] (version 65), to generate Python interfaces. There are [[./Talk_TranslatingNumericalPythonToC++_JohannesNix.pdf|some slides which explain the principle how it works]] .
* LMDB and its corresponding [[https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/en/release/|Python wrapper module]]

How to install and configure the dependencies is described in detail in [[../../INSTALL_LONG]].
