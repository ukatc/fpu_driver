====== Work Environment ======


The work environment for developing the fpu_driver
package is a normal Linux environment. Most of
the work was done on a Debian 9 System
(the developer laptop), and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
(the MOONS lab workstation). Parts of it were also
tested on Linux virtual  machines. The target system
is the ESO VLT Linux image which is a derivative of
Scientific Linux, which in turn is a variant of CentOS.

Detailed installation procedures are contained in the
file [[python/doc/INSTALL_LONG.txt]].

For a description of the main dependencies, see [[../Dependencies.txt]].
