====== EtherCAN simulation ======
Created Thursday 31 October 2019

==== EtherCAN gateway and FPU firmware simulation ====

In the folder "test/HardwareSimulation", there is test code that is
capable to simulate the operation of both FPUs, and the [[EtherCAN]] gateway
to such a degree that the driver, the verification software, and also scripts 
which move FPUs can be tested. Section C of the [[./manual.pdf]] explains
how to run the simulator. The simulation of individual FPU firmware
is implemented in file fpu_sim.py . 

The simulation is based on [[http://www.gevent.org/contents.html|gevent]] as asynchronous message
processing library. This makes the code for the simulation
both simple and fast, and also allows to use python because 
no parallel execution is required.

The simulation also covers events such as collisions or limit switch breaches.
These can be triggered by sending Unix signals to the simulation process.
Partly, they require the name of the FPU which should simulate the event to be
written to a text file.

The handled interrupts are defined in the last part of fpu_sim.py:

* SIGHUP : trigger an FPU reset for all FPUs
* SIGUSR1 : trigger a collision for all FPUs
* SIGUSR2 : trigger a limit switch breach for all FPUs
* SIGURG: cause a CAN message overflow for all FPUs
* SIGRTMIN : start a collision test, where the id of the tested FPU is read from the file "/var/tmp/colltest.fpuid"
