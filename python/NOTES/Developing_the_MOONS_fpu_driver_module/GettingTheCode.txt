====== GettingTheCode ======



===== Archive location =====


The central archive for the code is on the dalriada server., in the folder 
[[/home/jnix/MOONS/fpu_driver]]. 

The URL is ssh://dalriada.roe.ac.uk/home/jnix/MOONS/fpu_driver
To access it, a user account is required.


How to get the source code is described in the [[../Manual.txt|manual]], section 4.2. 

==== Protocol 1 and protocol 2 ====


One important thing to observe is that the git prepository for the driver is organized inn two main branches, the
CAN protocol 1 branch, and the CAN protocol 2 branch.

The protocol 1 branch was developed primarily for the MOONS FPU verification system. It has limited
protocol support and is missing some features which are required in the instrument. This branch has
the name "can1". At an earlier stage, the master branch of the git repositiry pointed to this branch,
but this is no longer the case.

The CAN protocol 2 branch is the current main version of the FPU driver software. The master branch
of the git repository is the protocol 2 branch.
