Created Friday 01 November 2019

The following tools have turned out to be helpful
for driver development:

* [[http://cppcheck.net/manual.pdf|cppcheck]] is a static code checking tool which can detect issues 
   like missing class member initializations and similar. 

* [[http://astyle.sourceforge.net/|astyle]] is an automatic source code formatter which can help 
  to adapt the whitespace and bracing style of the code
  to the used conding standard.


* [[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn|git-svn]] was used to keep local code changes in
  sync with the ESO SVN repository. [[+HowToUse_git-svn]]
