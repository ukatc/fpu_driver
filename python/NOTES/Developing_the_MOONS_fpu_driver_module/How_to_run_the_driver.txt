====== How to run the driver ======

The python module does not need to be specifically  installed. If the directory in which it resides is 
included in the PYTHONPATH environment
variable, it can be imported and run from the build
directory.


In the folder python there is a script with the name
[[initialiseGrid.py]]. Using this script as a template is 
perhaps the easiest way to start an FPU control script 
and test commands. The script is described in
section 20.1 of the [[../Manual.txt|manual]].

The manual has, in part I, section 2, a detailed introduction on how to write scripts and
control the FPUs.

There is also a list of examples and test scripts in Appendix A of the [[manual]].
